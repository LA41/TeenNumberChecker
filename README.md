# TeenNumberChecker
In this program I used two methods. First, isTeen, checks if typed value is between 13 and 19 inclusively. Second, hasTeen, calls the first method and checks whether any of three typed numbers returns true (if any number is a "teen number"). Is so, hasTeen will also return true.
